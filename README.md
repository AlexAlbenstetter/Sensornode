# Sensornode

## Description

The goal of this seminar paper was to build a prototype sensor system to collect mobile particulate matter data. For this purpose, a Raspberry pi was connected to a GPS module and sensor data of a laser fine dust sensor was collected every second. At the same time, the GPS position and the time stamp of each data point were recorded. The sensor system was then mounted on the roof of a vehicle and measurements were recorded while the vehicle was in motion. Subsequently, the fine dust measurement values could be mapped.
